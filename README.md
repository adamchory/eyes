# Eyes Exercise
This exercise has two eyes that follow the users mouse as it moves along the browser. This exercise demonstrates the ability to manipulate styles and positions in JavaScript, html, and css. By incoporating eyes.js and styles.css, a function will fire onmousemove. In this function the position of the client is tracked and scaled to translante the eyeballs ('ball') based on the user's x and y position in the browser and update styles.css. 

## How to Run?
Once index.html, styles.css, and eyes.js, are downloaded into a folder, load index.html into a browser.
Move your mouse around the browser window and watch the two eyes follow. 

## Roadmap of Future Impovements
An improvement to the two eye'd exercise would be writing a script to continually add eyes in random positions of the browser as the previous one disappears, while the eye(s) still follow the user's mouse. To do this, I will create a setTimeout function to randomly select new positions to then store and manipulate in the DOM.
